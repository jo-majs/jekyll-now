title: Length contraction in two space dimensions

## What was length contraction again?
####Anyone who has studied Special Relativity has heard of the fenomenon of length contraction. But we may be dusty on the details, so let's recap quickly.
In short, when an inertial observer sees an object moving relatively to him of herself with a constant velocity, he or she will measure the object's length to be shorter than when the object is at rest. 
$$ \nabla_\boldsymbol{x} J(\boldsymbol{x}) $$

$$ A = \left( \begin{matrix} 7 & 5 & 1 \\ 4 & 1 & 5 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{matrix} \right) $$

$$   \begin{bmatrix} C_1 & C_2 & C_3 & C_4 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix}
    z_1 \\
    z_2 \\
    z_3 \\
    z_4 \\
  \end{bmatrix} $$
  
$$ \begin{equation} x_B = \gamma x_C - \gamma \beta t_C 
\label{test}
\end{equation}$$

Can it put $$\Latex$$ in plain text, like this $$t_c$$ maybe?
