title: Length contraction in two space dimensions
---
This post contemplates the problem of length contraction in special relativity, using an example. While usually the fenomenon is introduced to students in one spatial dimension, it is interesting to consider a case with two spatial dimensions. The intended audience is familiar with the basics of special relativity, in particular with the Lorentz transformation in 3 dimensions. 
**SPOILER ALERT: Expect rotations!**
### A quick note on notation
The convention used here is quite standard but for clarity's sake worth specifying anyway. For a transformation from a stationary reference frame $$(ct, x, y)$$ to a reference frame $$(ct', x', y')$$ moving away at velocity $$v$$ along the $$x$$ axis, the Lorentz transformation is given by:  
$$  \left( \begin{matrix} ct' \\ x' \\ y' \\ \end{matrix} \right) = \left( \begin{matrix} \gamma & -\gamma\beta & 0 \\ -\gamma\beta & \gamma & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right) ( \begin{matrix} ct \\ x \\ y \\ \end{matrix}) $$  
$$\gamma = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}, \beta = v/c$$.  
Of course, $$c$$ is the speed of light in a vacuum (we assume everything here happens in a vacuum, because physics is hard enough already).

### What was length contraction again?
Anyone who has studied special relativity has heard of the fenomenon of length contraction. But we may be dusty on the details, so let's recap quickly.  
Simply put, an object's length is shorter when the object is moving along this length relative to the reference frame in which it's being measured. Let's consider a simple example in one spatial dimension, to wrap our minds around that abstract sentence. If Alice measures a resting bee and gets the length $$L$$, when the bee starts flying away with velocity $$v$$, Alice will measure it's length to be shorter!  
Specifically, it will be equal to $$\dfrac{1}{\gamma}L$$.  
I hope that none of this is surprising to you, so far, even though special relativity is oficially mind-bending. If need be, you can pause and refresh your memory so that you can be comfortable with this basic concept, before we go on.

# So how about two spatial dimensions?
Let's dig in a little deeper and consider a more complex situation  

$$ A = \left( \begin{matrix} 7 & 5 & 1 \\ 4 & 1 & 5 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{matrix} \right) $$

$$   \begin{bmatrix} C_1 & C_2 & C_3 & C_4 \end{bmatrix}  \begin{bmatrix}
    z_1 \\
    z_2 \\
    z_3 \\
    z_4 \\
  \end{bmatrix} $$
  
$$ \begin{equation} x_B = \gamma x_C - \gamma \beta t_C 
\label{test}
\end{equation}$$

Can it put $$\Latex$$ in plain text, like this $$t_c$$ maybe?
