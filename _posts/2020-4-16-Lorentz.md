title: Length contraction in two spatial dimensions
---
In this post I contemplate the problem of length contraction in special relativity, using an illustrated example. While usually the fenomenon of length contraction is introduced to students in one spatial dimension, it is interesting to consider a case with two spatial dimensions. The intended audience is familiar with the basics of special relativity, in particular with the Lorentz transformation in 3 dimensions.  
**SPOILER ALERT: Expect rotations!**
### A quick note on notation
The convention used here is quite standard but for clarity's sake worth specifying anyway. For a transformation from a stationary reference frame $$(ct, x, y)$$ to a reference frame $$(ct', x', y')$$ moving away at velocity $$v$$ along the $$x$$ axis, the Lorentz transformation is given by:  
  
$$  
\left( \begin{matrix} ct' \\ x' \\ y' \\ \end{matrix} \right) =
\left( \begin{matrix} \gamma & -\gamma\beta & 0 \\ -\gamma\beta & \gamma & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{matrix} \right)
\left( \begin{matrix} ct \\ x \\ y \\ \end{matrix}\right)
$$.  
  
The coefficients $$\beta, \gamma$$ are:
$$\gamma = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}, \beta = v/c$$.  
Of course, $$c$$ is the speed of light in a vacuum (we assume everything here happens in a vacuum, because physics is hard enough already).

### What was length contraction again?
Anyone who has studied special relativity has heard of the fenomenon of length contraction. But we may be dusty on the details, so let's recap quickly.  
Simply put, an object's length is shorter when the object is moving along this length relative to the reference frame in which it's being measured. Let's consider a simple example in one spatial dimension, to wrap our minds around that abstract sentence. If Alice measures a resting Bee and gets the length $$L$$, when the Bee starts flying away with velocity $$v$$, Alice will measure it's length to be shorter!  
Specifically, it will be equal to $$\dfrac{1}{\gamma}L$$.  
I hope that none of this is surprising to you, so far, even though special relativity is oficially mind-bending. If need be, you can pause and refresh your memory so that you can be comfortable with this basic concept, before we go on.

# So how about two spatial dimensions?
Let's dig in a little deeper and consider a more complex situation. Let's introduce an inertial observer, Carl, who sees the following situation: Alice is hovering on a platform with an upward velocity $$v_A$$ relative to Carl. In the meantime, the Bee is travelling on a hoverboard horizontally relative to him, with a velocity $$v_B$$. There is a hole in Alice's platform which Carl measures to have length $$L$$. In his reference frame also the Bee's hoverboard has length $$L$$. So according to him, the Bee on the board will be able to pass through Alice's platform.

But wait, the board is moving along it's length relative to Carl. So he sees it as shorter than the Bee sees it. Moreover, in the Bee's reference frame, it's Alice and her platform that are moving toward the bee with velocity $$-v_B$$ (in addition to the component coming from $$v_A$$). So not only is the resting length of the Bee's board $$>L$$, the hole in Alice's platform is also $$<L$$. Can that be right? If the board passes through the hole in Carl's reference frame, surely it also has to do so in all other intertial reference frames? If it didn't, there would exist a priviliged reference frame, which is against the assumptions of the theory of relativity! So is the theory wrong or can we save it?  

### Setting up Carl's reference frame

Lets set up Carl's reference frame so that his coordinates $$(0, 0, 0)$$ describe the spacetime event when the Bee's board's left end ($$BL$$) meets the left end of the hole in Alice's platform ($$AL$$). Of course their right ends ($$AR, BR$$) meet at the same time. In other words, at Carl's time $$= 0 $$, the board is passing through the hole. We can propose the following description for the coordinates of $$AL, AR, BL, BR$$:
  
$$
AL_C = \left( \begin{matrix} ct_C\\ 0 \\ v_A t_C \\ \end{matrix} \right),
AR_C = \left( \begin{matrix} ct_C\\ L \\ v_A t_C \\ \end{matrix} \right),
BL_C = \left( \begin{matrix} ct_C\\ v_B t_C \\ 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right),
BR_C = \left( \begin{matrix} ct_C\\ v_B t_C + L\\ 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right).
$$  
  
We see that at $$t_C = 0$$ the appropriate ends meet and the board is indeed passing through the hole. What's next? Let's see if in the Bee's reference frame the situation is as dramatic as we predicted. Can its board pass through the hole?

### Transforming to the Bee's reference frame
Using the Lorentz transformation in the form given in the introduction, we can transform those four spacetime events - the simultaneous ends of the hole and the board in Carl's reference frame - into the Bee's reference frame. Of course the velocity which is included in $$\beta$$ will be $$v_B$$ here, since that's how fast the Bee is travelling relative to Carl. We get:  
  
$$
AL_B = \left( \begin{matrix} c\gamma t_C\\ -\gamma v_B t_B \\ v_A t_B \\ \end{matrix} \right),
AR_B = \left( \begin{matrix} c(\gamma t_B - \dfrac{v_B L \gamma}{c^2})\\ \gamma (L-v_1 t_B) \\ v_A t_B \\ \end{matrix} \right),
\\
BL_B = \left( \begin{matrix} \dfrac{ct_B}{\gamma}\\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right),
BR_B = \left( \begin{matrix} \dfrac{ct_B}{\gamma} - \dfrac{\gamma v_B L}{c}\\ \gamma L \\ 0 \\ \end{matrix} \right).
$$  
  
Don't take my word for it, make sure to check it yourself!  
Assuming these results are correct, are you surprised? We know that events which are simultaneous in one frame, don't have to be simultaneous in another. And indeed, we see that what Carl perceives as simultaneous - an event of the Bee's board's ends being at certain locations - is not simultaneous from the Bee's point of view. We could have seen it coming but it still seems kind of weird, doesn't it? So let's see how the Bee perceives it.

### Simultaneity from the Bee's point of view
In order to see things from the Bee's point of view, we need to get rid of the parameter $$t_C$$ in the coordinates above, by expressing it it terms of $$t_B$$. What we really want to know is how the Bee sees Alice's platform, so that's what we'll focus on. Instead of using $$t_C$$ to describe the $$x_B$$ and $$y_B$$ coordinate of the hole's left end in the Bee's frame ($$AL_B$$), we'll substitute it with $$\gamma t_B$$. Analogously, in the coordinates of $$AR_B$$, we'll use $$\dfrac{1}{\gamma}t_B + \dfrac{v_B L}{c^2}$$ instead of $$t_C$$. We get:  
  
$$
AL_B = \left( \begin{matrix} ct_B\\ -v_B t_B \\ \dfrac{1}{\gamma}v_A t_B \\ \end{matrix} \right),
AR_B = \left( \begin{matrix} ct_B\\ \dfrac{L}{\gamma} - v_B t_B\\ \dfrac{1}{\gamma}v_A t_B + \dfrac{v_A v_BL}{c^2}\\ \end{matrix} \right).
$$  

### What does it mean? 
Let's see what happens at $$t_B = 0$$.

The Bee sees Alice's platform as if it was rotated! So we were right - the Bee's board in its own reference frame is indeed longer than the hole's length. But at the same time the board is able to pass through the hole because they are rotated relative to each other. So the equivalence of reference frames seems to be right as well, after all! If objects don't crash into each other in one intertial frame, they won't do it in any other. If we *go back in time* in the Bee's frame, we can see that first the board's right end entered the hole and was followed by the left end significantly later. There were no crashes observed. What's worth noticing is that the vertical component of the velocity of Alice's platform relative to the Bee, $$v_A$$, is no longer perpendicular to her platform's length, nor is $$v_B$$ directed along it.

### Summary
What can we remember from this example?  
* That the Lorentz transformation can give us rotations other than those most obvious.  
* That velocities in 2 spatial dimensions transform more complexly than we could have expected. If we had just added the velocities $$v_A$$ and $$-v_B$$ and assumed that Alice moves with that velocity relative to the Bee on a platform parallel relative to the Bee's board, we would have gotten nonsensical results from the Lorentz transformation (check it!).  
* And that despite some seeming paradoxes, the theory of relativity seems to hold its ground. But you're free to try to disprove it!;)
